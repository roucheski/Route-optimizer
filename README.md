# Route-optimizer
This app helps plan and optimize employee transport routes from various pick-up points to company plants. It calculates the most efficient paths, displays route distances, and marks each pick-up in sequence. By identifying detours and inefficiencies, it supports cost reduction and better scheduling for worker transportation.
